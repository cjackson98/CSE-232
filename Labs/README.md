Structured similarly to the CSE 231 class.

These labs were small, simple assignments done in class with a partner. In these labs, we were taught new C++/other programming concepts were then given assignments to practice. Some labs are not included becuase we were instructed to only work on one machine and so some labs were done on the machines of my partner.
