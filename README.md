Introduction to Programming II offered by MSU. Taken in the FS17 semester. Taught by Bill Punch. This was my second programming class taken at a college level. Reinforced and furthered my basic knowledge of C++ and introduced me to new programming concepts (such as memory management, pointers, etc).
